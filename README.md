Overview of the ProjectTASK 2

Project: Design FSMs using Verilog or VHDL

1.Specification and State Diagram Requirements: Clearly define the behavior and functionality of the FSM. State Diagram: Create a state diagram that illustrates the states, transitions, inputs, and outputs of the FSM.

State Encoding Binary Encoding: Assign binary codes to each state for implementation in Verilog or VHDL. One-Hot Encoding: Alternatively, use one-hot encoding where each state is represented by a unique bit position.

Designing the FSM State and Output Definitions: Define states and output signals as variables in Verilog or VHDL. State Register: Use a register to hold the current state of the FSM. Next State Logic: Implement combinational logic that determines the next state based on current state and inputs. Output Logic: Implement combinational logic that determines outputs based on current state and inputs.

Behavioral Implementation in Verilog or VHDL Verilog Syntax: Define states and transitions using always blocks and case statements (for Verilog). VHDL Syntax: Define states, transitions, and processes using process statements and case statements (for VHDL).
